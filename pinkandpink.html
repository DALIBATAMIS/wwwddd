        I AM THE WICK OF A BURNING CANDLE

    <p class="thetext">
        Blobs of pink surround my bare skin, like rose petal lookalikes, faux as the silver on my fingers; tangent pink engulfs me. 
        I sit on my bed, crouched in a fetus position, slowly running my fingers on the peach fuzz of my legs. 
        I shiver on every touch my finger makes on the sensitive hair; ticking bursts of stimulation near my exposed ribs. 
        I'm baptizing in pink ros√®.
        The satin finish of the uninsides of my pink boxers slide frictionlessly as I sit up to hug my knees, putting my chin on them. 
        Bone and bone collide making a muted click sound. I smell of grapefruit and salt. 
        A blue morning peeks through my checkered-glass, open window, the hue backdropping onto the wall behind my bed, 
        whilst the fractured light from the sun illuminates me pink. I'm the wick of a burning candle.
